# Aave Credit Score Analysis

## Overview
This analysis evaluates Ethereum wallet credit scores based on historical transaction data. The scoring model uses features engineered from wallet activityâ€”such as transaction count, volume, and interactions with DeFi protocolsâ€”to produce a creditworthiness estimate.

##  Dataset Summary
- **Source**: `user-wallet-transactions.json`
- **Total Wallets Analyzed**: X (replace with actual count)
- **Features Used**:
  - Transaction frequency
  - Transaction volume
  - Number of unique counterparties
  - Average time between transactions
  - Interactions with protocols (e.g., Aave, Uniswap)
  - Gas fees paid

##  Distribution of Credit Scores
| Range           | Wallet Count |
|-----------------|--------------|
| 0.0             | 2997        |
| 0.1 - 2.5       | more than >800         |
| 2.6 - 5.0       | more than >150           |
| 5.1 - 10.0      | less than >150           |
| 10.1 and above  | less than <20           |

> **Note**: A significant portion of wallets received a score of **0.0**, indicating limited or no meaningful activity.

## Observations
- ðŸŸ¥ **Inactive wallets** (no or minimal transactions) dominate the dataset.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Low-moderate scores** (1â€“5 range) typically belong to wallets with modest but consistent DeFi engagement.
- ðŸŸ© **Higher scores** (10+) were given to wallets with:
  - Frequent activity
  - Interactions with multiple DeFi protocols
  - High transaction volumes
  - Regular repayment of loans (where data exists)

##  Model Insights
- **Model Used**: (e.g., `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`)  
  *(Update based on your model.py content)*
- **Scaling Method**: MinMaxScaler from `sklearn`
- **Score Range**: 0 to ~20  
- **Limitations**:
  - No off-chain credit data
  - Data quality affects score reliability
  - Temporal bias if data is not recent
