# Aave Credit Score Analysis

## Overview
This analysis evaluates Ethereum wallet credit scores based on historical transaction data. The scoring model uses features engineered from wallet activityâ€”such as transaction count, volume, and interactions with DeFi protocolsâ€”to produce a creditworthiness estimate.

## Observations
- ðŸŸ¥ **Inactive wallets** (no or minimal transactions) dominate the dataset.
- ðŸŸ¨ **Low-moderate scores** (1â€“5 range) typically belong to wallets with modest but consistent DeFi engagement.
- ðŸŸ© **Higher scores** (10+) were given to wallets with:
  - Frequent activity
  - Interactions with multiple DeFi protocols
  - High transaction volumes
  - Regular repayment of loans (where data exists)

##  Model Insights
- **Model Used**: (e.g., `Linear Regression`, `Random Forest`)  
  *(Update based on your model.py content)*
- **Scaling Method**: MinMaxScaler from `sklearn`
- **Score Range**: 0 to ~20  
- **Limitations**:
  - No off-chain credit data
  - Data quality affects score reliability
  - Temporal bias if data is not recent
